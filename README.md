## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computing and electrical engineering student at Tampere university. 

I enjoy working on my own projects whenever I have the time.
- Currently I am working mainly on my messenger project, which is just a fun little Java exercise for some basic socket programming and concurrency.
