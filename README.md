## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computing and electrical engineering student at Tampere university. 

I enjoy working on my own projects whenever I have the time.
- Currently I am working on a city bike app, which uses React for frontend and Java with Spring and Docker for backend. For the time being this repository is private.
- My second, previously active Java messenger project has been put on hold as I am starting work on the city bike app.
