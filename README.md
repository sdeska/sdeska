## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computing and electrical engineering student at Tampere university, with my major and minor in communications and software engineering respectively.
Currently working as a junior backend developer.

I enjoy working on my own projects whenever I have the time.
- Currently I am working on a city bike app written in Java, using Spring and a Postgres database. Dockerized.
